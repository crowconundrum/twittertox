                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Elon Musk has made Twitter his own and changed the platform to suit his likes and wants. 
                    How has that affected Twitter's reputation and success? How has that affected Elon's reputation and his other companies?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How has the market valuation and usage of the platform been affected?
                    And how has Elon's friendship with Donald Trump progressed since buying the platform?
                    With this timeline, you can track this and much more.

                                After his offer, Twitter‚Äôs board initially resisted Elon Musk‚Äôs acquisition attempt by enacting a ‚Äúpoison pill‚Äù ‚Äî a strategy where shareholders are offered discounted stock to dilute a dominant investor‚Äôs stake. This move made it harder for Musk to take control without negotiation. After further discussions, the board accepted his $44 billion offer on April 25th.

                                This move marked a pivotal shift in the company‚Äôs ownership structure, setting the stage for rapid executive turnover, platform rebranding, and major shifts in policy. Though controversial, the acceptance of Musk‚Äôs offer reshaped the public and financial trajectory of the platform.

                                        Within just days of Elon Musk‚Äôs ownership, 50% of Twitter staff had been laid off. He then unbanned Donald Trump‚Äôs Twitter account and introduced Twitter Blue, a new subscription-based verification system.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This would replace Twitter‚Äôs prior verification system, where verifications were given to popular figures such as celebrities, organizations, and journalists. With Twitter Blue, anyone can pay $8 to receive a verification badge and prioritization in the algorithm.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Although Elon Musk believed this would lessen spam, this quickly led to large amounts of spam bot accounts purchasing Twitter Blue. With a verification checkmark, these bots could flood comment sections, impersonate people, and scam others at much higher rates than before.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="lead">
                                        On July 23, 2023, Musk abruptly announced Twitter would be renamed "X" and began replacing the iconic blue bird logo. The next day, the Twitter sign at headquarters was replaced with a flashing "X". This was due to his desire to rebrand Twitter entirely into an "everything app", similar to China's WeChat, integrating social media, payments, shopping, and other services. However, many users and experts were skeptical about the rebrand, viewing it as abandoning twenty years of Twitter's brand equity.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This change reflected Musk's long-standing "X" fixation‚Äîhe previously founded X.com (which later became part of PayPal), SpaceX, and even included X in his son's name.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This change was controversial, with some people excited for change and others frustrated at the abandonment of the platform they loved. Many believe this rebrand was a large failure, with the company losing 70% of its market value since Musk‚Äôs ownership (as of September 2024).

                                        According to YouGov data, the rebranding of Twitter to X has seen mixed results. The platform‚Äôs brand perception initially plummeted after Musk‚Äôs acquisition but showed signs of slow recovery by mid-2024. However, half of Americans still refer to the platform as ‚ÄúTwitter,‚Äù and the rebrand has not restored user trust to pre-Musk levels.

                                        The Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) published research showing that X (formerly Twitter) failed to remove hate speech and harmful content, even after it was reported. They claimed the platform was no longer enforcing its content moderation policies.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In response, X filed a lawsuit accusing CCDH of harming its reputation and contributing to a drop in ad revenue. X also alleged the nonprofit gained unauthorized access to internal data.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Around this time, Elon Musk announced controversial changes to the block feature. Previously, blocking someone prevented both parties from seeing or interacting with each other‚Äôs content. Under the new rules, blocked users can still view posts from accounts that blocked them, but cannot reply or engage. 
                                    </p>

                                        This change was widely criticized, especially by users who rely on the block feature to avoid harassment and stalking. Musk had hoped to remove the feature entirely, but doing so risked X being banned from the Apple and Google Play stores.

                            <p>Advertising revenue also declined steeply, with many major advertisers pausing spending on X due to relaxed content moderation and increased hate speech on the platform. Musk himself admitted the company's ad revenue had fallen by approximately 50%.</p>

                                        In March 2024, X lost its lawsuit against the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). The case centered around the nonprofit‚Äôs use of automated data collection to expose X‚Äôs failures in moderating hate speech and harmful content.

                                        A California District Court ruled that the CCDH‚Äôs data scraping activities were protected, as they served the public interest by holding platforms accountable. The court found X‚Äôs motivations for the lawsuit to be retaliatory‚Äîan attempt to silence criticism that harmed the platform‚Äôs advertising revenue, rather than a legitimate concern about data access.

                                        During the 2024 Presidential Election between candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Elon Musk showed continual support for Trump. 
                                        He heavily utilized Twitter to campaign for his presidency through countless Tweets, livestreams, and fundraisers.

                                        On top of using Twitter to support Trump, Musk formed a super PAC and donated more than $200 million to it. 
                                        Many people became frustrated at the large amounts of pro-Trump content overrunning Twitter during this time.

                                Multiple tech billionaires, including Elon Musk, stood behind Trump during his inauguration. At a post-inauguration rally, Musk gave a celebratory speech, emphasizing his excitement for the future of the United States. During this speech, Musk twice gestured a salute that many compared to the Nazi salute. This action drew extremely heavy controversy, with angry reactions from all over the globe. Some European political parties demanded that he be banned from entering their countries. On the other hand, some white supremacist groups celebrated this salute. Musk denied that this was a Nazi salute, but many people firmly believe it was.

                                On January 20th, Donald Trump created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This new department was established to cut wasteful federal spending, with efforts led by Elon Musk.

                                Immediately, a DOGE Twitter page was created with a verification badge designating it as a government organization. The account began sharing updates and accepting user tips via direct message on how to reduce wasteful spending.

This caused many to perceive DOGE and Twitter/X as closely intertwined. Congress has yet to officially authorize the department.

                                    As negative public perception towards Elon Musk grew, his companies began facing further backlash. Vandalism of Tesla Cybertrucks increased rapidly, with many videos and images shared on Twitter. Some incidents showed egged vehicles, while others displayed spray-painted swastikas and anti-Elon messages.

                                    At the same time, users noticed that Grok, X's AI assistant, had stopped giving honest or critical answers about Elon Musk. After a wave of screenshots showing Grok calling Musk a "disinformation spreader" and saying he wasn't a good person, it suddenly began avoiding criticism. Users began questioning Grok until it admitted its code had been altered, sparking accusations of censorship on a so-called ‚Äúfree-speech platform.‚Äù

Musk stated that this would unlock new potential by combining the companies‚Äô capabilities, with xAI having advanced AI and X having massive reach.
