                <p>
                    Elon Musk has made Twitter his own and changed the platform to suit his likes and wants. 
                    How has that affected Twitter's reputation and success? How has that affected Elon's reputation and his other companies?
                </p>
                <p>
                    How has the market valuation and usage of the platform been affected?
                    And how has Elon's friendship with Donald Trump progressed since buying the platform?
                    With this timeline, you can track this and much more.

                    content: `
                        <p>Prior to announcing his acquisition offer, Musk had quietly bought 9.2% of Twitter's shares, becoming the company's largest shareholder. On April 14, he offered to buy Twitter outright for $54.20 per share, valuing the company at about $44 billion.</p>
                        <p>Musk stated in his proposal: "Twitter has tremendous potential. I will unlock it." He emphasized Twitter needed to be transformed as a private company to serve its role as a platform for free speech.</p>
                        <p>The offer represented a premium of about 38% over Twitter's market price at that time and drew significant attention. Twitter's board initially adopted a "poison pill" strategy to resist the acquisition.</p>

                },
                2: {
                    title: "Deal Completion and Immediate Changes",
                    content: `
                        <p>On October 27, 2022, after complex negotiations, deal suspensions, and legal challenges, Musk finally completed the Twitter acquisition at the originally proposed price. His first action was to fire CEO Parag Agrawal, CFO Ned Segal, and head of legal policy Vijaya Gadde.</p>
                        <p>The iconic image of Musk carrying a sink into Twitter HQ, with his tweet "let that sink in," marked this moment.</p>
                        <p>Within days of the acquisition, he announced plans to cut about 50% of staff and began reassessing the platform's content moderation policies.</p>

                    title: "Verification System Chaos",
                    content: `
                        <p>Musk launched a revised Twitter Blue subscription service for $8 per month that included access to the blue verification checkmark - previously only given to verified celebrities, politicians, journalists, and public figures.</p>
                        <p>This change led to a surge of impersonation accounts on the platform, with some fake accounts impersonating companies causing billions in market value losses for real companies. For example, a fake Eli Lilly account tweeted "insulin is now free," causing the company's stock to plummet.</p>
                        <p>Twitter had to pause the service and relaunch it later with additional verification steps.</p>

                    content: `
                        <p>On July 23, 2023, Musk abruptly announced Twitter would be renamed "X" and began replacing the iconic blue bird logo. The next day, the Twitter sign at headquarters was replaced with a flashing "X".</p>
                        <p>This change reflected Musk's long-standing "X" fixation - he previously founded X.com (which later became part of PayPal), SpaceX, and even included X in his son's name.</p>
                        <p>Musk described X as becoming an "everything app" similar to China's WeChat, integrating social media, payments, shopping, and other services. However, many users and experts were skeptical about the rebrand, viewing it as abandoning twenty years of Twitter's brand equity.</p>

                    content: `
                        <p>By early 2024, multiple reports indicated X's valuation had fallen to about $15 billion, just a third of what Musk paid. Internal documents showed declining daily and monthly active users.</p>
                        <p>Multiple studies suggested users were migrating to rival platforms like Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon in large numbers, particularly in news and media sectors in the US and Europe.</p>
                        <p>Advertising revenue also declined steeply, with many major advertisers pausing spending on X due to relaxed content moderation and increased hate speech on the platform. Musk himself admitted the company's ad revenue had fallen by approximately 50%.</p>
